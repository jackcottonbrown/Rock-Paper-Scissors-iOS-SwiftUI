# Rock Paper Scissors iOS SwiftUI
Rock paper scissors is an iOS app built using SwiftUI that simulates a game of R.P.S.

Core Features:
- Voice activated game commands
- Animated emojis
- Rock, paper, and scissors sound effects.

Design Considerations:
- After 10 turns, restart the game.
- The computer picks their move randomly from an array of potential moves.
- Change the colour of the text based on score.

My Extensions:
- Added in voice commands using Speech so the app can detect the words "rock", "paper", and "scissors" and run code conditionally, based on this.
- Added in custom audio files for the rock, paper, scissors sounds effects.
